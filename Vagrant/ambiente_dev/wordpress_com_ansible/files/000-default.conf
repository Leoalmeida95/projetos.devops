        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request´s Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not devisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicity.
